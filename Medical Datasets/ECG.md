## All about ECG Dataset

## Introduction to ECG Data
Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) data is a representation of the electrical activity of the heart over time. It is commonly used by medical professionals to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular diseases, such as arrhythmias, heart attacks, and heart failure. ECG data is captured using electrodes placed on the skin, which measure the heart's electrical impulses and display them as waveforms. It is used for diagnosing and monitoring various cardiovascular conditions, such as arrhythmias, heart attacks, and other heart diseases. ECG signals are typically represented as time-series data where each data point corresponds to the heart's electrical activity at a specific time.

### Why is ECG Important?
- **Heart Health Monitoring:** ECG signals help detect abnormalities in heart rhythm and function.
- **Non-Invasive:** The procedure is simple, painless, and widely used in clinical settings.
- **Predictive Analysis:** ECG data enables early detection of life-threatening conditions like myocardial infarction.
- **Data-Driven Diagnostics:** With machine learning, ECG data can be analyzed automatically for efficient diagnosis.

### Understanding ECG Waveforms
ECG signals consist of different segments and waveforms that represent the different electrical activities of the heart:
- **P-Wave:** Represents atrial depolarization (activation of the upper chambers of the heart).
- **QRS Complex:** Represents ventricular depolarization (activation of the lower chambers of the heart).
- **T-Wave:** Represents ventricular repolarization (recovery after contraction).

Each of these features is essential in diagnosing various heart conditions.

### Structure of ECG Data
ECG data is typically represented as time-series data, where each recorded point corresponds to the heart's electrical activity at a specific time. The key components of ECG data include:
- **Lead Configurations:** ECG signals can be captured using different lead placements, such as 12-lead ECG or single-lead ECG.
- **Amplitude (Voltage):** Measures the electrical activity of the heart in microvolts (µV).
- **Sampling Rate:** ECG signals are sampled at rates between 250 Hz and 1000 Hz to capture detailed variations.
- **Annotations:** Some datasets include manually labeled annotations for heartbeats, arrhythmias, or other cardiac events.

### Common ECG Data Formats:
- **CSV Format:** A simple text format with time-series data, where each row corresponds to a timestamp and its respective ECG value.
- **WFDB Format:** The PhysioNet database often uses the WFDB format, which includes both header files and data files, storing ECG signals and their metadata.
- **EDF Format:** A standard file format used to store continuous physiological signals, such as ECG, EEG, and EMG.

### Components of ECG Data:
- **Lead Channels:** ECG data can include multiple leads, which are the different electrode placements on the body. Common leads are Lead I, Lead II, Lead III, V1, V2, etc.
- **Signal Values:** The signal represents the electrical activity of the heart recorded over time, typically with units of microvolts (µV).
- **Annotations:** In some datasets, annotations mark specific events in the ECG signal (e.g., R-peaks, QRS complex, arrhythmia events).

## Preprocessing ECG Data
Preprocessing ECG data is crucial to remove noise, normalize signals, extract features, and prepare the data for machine learning models.

### 1. Noise Filtering
ECG signals can be affected by noise from sources such as power-line interference, motion artifacts, and muscle contractions. A bandpass filter helps remove unwanted frequency components.

**Code Example:**
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.signal as signal
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a simulated noisy ECG signal
ecgr = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 1 * np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 1000)

# Design a bandpass filter
fs = 1000  # Sampling frequency
low_cutoff = 0.5  # Low cutoff frequency
high_cutoff = 50  # High cutoff frequency
b, a = signal.butter(4, [low_cutoff / (0.5 * fs), high_cutoff / (0.5 * fs)], btype='band')
filtered_ecg = signal.filtfilt(b, a, ecgr)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.plot(ecgr)
plt.title("Original Noisy ECG Signal")
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(filtered_ecg)
plt.title("Filtered ECG Signal")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Explanation of Code:**
- **Generates a noisy ECG signal** (replace with real ECG data).
- **Applies a Butterworth bandpass filter** to remove noise outside the 0.5-50 Hz range.
- **Plots the original and filtered signals.**

**Expected Output:**
- A filtered ECG signal with reduced noise.

---

### 2. Signal Normalization
Normalization ensures that ECG values fall within a consistent range, improving model performance.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Normalize the ECG signal to range [0, 1]
normalized_ecg = (filtered_ecg - np.min(filtered_ecg)) / (np.max(filtered_ecg) - np.min(filtered_ecg))

# Alternatively, normalize to range [-1, 1]
normalized_ecg_alt = 2 * (filtered_ecg - np.min(filtered_ecg)) / (np.max(filtered_ecg) - np.min(filtered_ecg)) - 1
```

**Explanation of Code:**
- **Rescales ECG values** to the range [0,1] or [-1,1].
- **Helps with convergence during machine learning training.**

**Expected Output:**
- Normalized ECG signal.

---

### 3. Baseline Wander Removal
Baseline wander is a low-frequency noise component that can distort ECG signals.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Remove baseline wander using a high-pass filter
baseline_wander_filtered = signal.detrend(filtered_ecg)
```

**Explanation of Code:**
- **Removes slow signal drifts** caused by respiration or electrode movement.
- **Uses `detrend` function** to eliminate baseline shifts.

**Expected Output:**
- ECG signal without baseline drift.

---

### 4. Peak Detection (R-Peak Identification)
Detecting R-peaks is essential for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and classification tasks.

**Code Example:**
```python
from scipy.signal import find_peaks

# Detect R-peaks
peaks, _ = find_peaks(filtered_ecg, height=0.5, distance=50)  # Adjust height & distance accordingly

# Plot detected peaks
plt.plot(filtered_ecg)
plt.plot(peaks, filtered_ecg[peaks], "ro")  # Mark R-peaks
plt.title("Detected R-Peaks")
plt.show()
```

**Explanation of Code:**
- **Uses `find_peaks`** to identify R-peaks in the ECG signal.
- **Adjusts height and distance parameters** based on signal properties.
- **Plots the detected peaks.**

**Expected Output:**
- An ECG signal with R-peaks marked.

---

### 5. Segmenting ECG Beats
ECG signals are often divided into segments for training deep learning models.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Segment the ECG signal into beats of 256 samples each
ecgr_segments = np.array([filtered_ecg[i:i+256] for i in range(0, len(filtered_ecg)-256, 256)])
```

**Explanation of Code:**
- **Splits ECG signals** into fixed-length segments (e.g., 256 samples).
- **Useful for deep learning models like CNNs and LSTMs.**

**Expected Output:**
- An array of segmented ECG beats.

---

### 6. Converting ECG Data into Images
For CNN-based models, ECG signals can be converted into spectrograms or waveforms.

**Code Example:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os

# Define output directory
output_dir = "ecg_images"
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Save each ECG segment as an image
for i, segment in enumerate(ecgr_segments):
    plt.figure(figsize=(3, 3))
    plt.plot(segment)
    plt.axis("off")  # Remove axes
    plt.savefig(f"{output_dir}/ecg_{i}.png", bbox_inches='tight', pad_inches=0)
    plt.close()
```

**Explanation of Code:**
- **Creates spectrogram-like images** of ECG waveforms.
- **Useful for CNN-based image classification models.**

**Expected Output:**
- ECG waveform images stored as PNG files.

---

### 7. Transforming ECG Data for LSTMs
For sequential models like LSTMs, ECG data needs to be reshaped properly.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Reshape for LSTM input
lstm_ready_ecg = ecgr_segments.reshape(ecgr_segments.shape[0], ecgr_segments.shape[1], 1)
```

**Explanation of Code:**
- **Reshapes ECG segments** to match LSTM input format `(samples, timesteps, features)`.

**Expected Output:**
- A properly shaped ECG dataset for LSTM models.

## 2. Using ECG Data in Machine/Deep Learning Models
Once the ECG data is preprocessed, it can be integrated into deep learning models for tasks such as arrhythmia detection, heart rate prediction, and anomaly detection.

### 2.1 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for ECG Classification
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective in extracting spatial features from ECG signals.

**Code Example:**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Define a 1D CNN model for ECG classification
model = Sequential([
    Conv1D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(256, 1)),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Conv1D(128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Display model summary
model.summary()
```

**Explanation of Code:**
- **Conv1D Layers:** Extracts spatial features from ECG signals.
- **MaxPooling1D Layers:** Reduces complexity and overfitting.
- **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers for classification.
- **Dropout Layer:** Prevents overfitting.
- **Binary Output:** Uses sigmoid activation for classification.

### 2.2 Training the CNN Model
**Code Example:**
```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(train_dataset, validation_data=validation_dataset, epochs=20, batch_size=32)
```

**Expected Output:**
- The training process logs accuracy and loss values.

### 2.3 Evaluating and Testing the Model
**Code Example:**
```python
# Evaluate the model on test dataset
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_dataset)
print(f"Test Loss: {test_loss}, Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy}")

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(test_dataset)
```

### 2.4 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network for ECG Sequence Analysis
LSTMs are useful for learning temporal patterns in ECG signals.

**Code Example:**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM

# Define an LSTM model for ECG classification
lstm_model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(256, 1)),
    LSTM(128),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
lstm_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = lstm_model.fit(train_dataset, validation_data=validation_dataset, epochs=20, batch_size=32)
```

### 2.5 Deploying the Model for Real-Time ECG Analysis
**Code Example:**
```python
# Load a new ECG signal for real-time prediction
new_ecg_signal = np.random.rand(256, 1)  # Replace with actual ECG data
new_ecg_signal = new_ecg_signal.reshape(1, 256, 1)

# Predict using the trained model
prediction = model.predict(new_ecg_signal)

# Interpret the result
if prediction[0] > 0.5:
    print("Arrhythmia detected")
else:
    print("Normal ECG")
```

### 2.6 Visualizing Model Performance
**Code Example:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot accuracy
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
